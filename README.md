# Todo-Solid-TypeScript

This is the [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com/)/[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) version of the **TodoMatic** example modified from my [React](https://github.com/alankrantas/todo-react-typescript) version. Solid is very similar to React except it dosen't use virtual DOM and is fully reactive.
